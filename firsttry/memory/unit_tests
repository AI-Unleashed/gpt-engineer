To generate tests based on the above specification, we will use the `pytest` library. We will create a test file for each class and test their methods according to the specification.

```test_snake.py
import pytest
from snake import Snake

def test_move():
    # Test the move method by checking if the snake's position is updated correctly
    pass

def test_grow():
    # Test the grow method by checking if the snake's size is increased
    pass

def test_collides_with_itself():
    # Test the collides_with_itself method by checking if it returns True when the snake collides with itself
    pass

def test_collides_with_boundary():
    # Test the collides_with_boundary method by checking if it returns True when the snake collides with the grid boundaries
    pass
```

```test_food.py
import pytest
from food import Food

def test_generate_new_position():
    # Test the generate_new_position method by checking if the food's position is updated to a valid position within the grid
    pass
```

```test_game_model.py
import pytest
from game_model import GameModel

def test_update():
    # Test the update method by checking if the game state is updated correctly, including the snake's movement and collision checks
    pass

def test_restart():
    # Test the restart method by checking if the game state is reset to its initial state
    pass
```

```test_game_view.py
import pytest
from game_view import GameView

def test_draw():
    # Test the draw method by checking if the game state is displayed correctly, including the snake, food, and score
    pass
```

```test_game_controller.py
import pytest
from game_controller import GameController

def test_handle_key_press():
    # Test the handle_key_press method by checking if the snake's direction is updated correctly based on the pressed key
    pass

def test_run():
    # Test the run method by checking if the main game loop updates the model and view based on user input
    pass
```

These test files contain the basic structure for testing each class and their methods according to the specification. The actual test implementation should be added in the respective test functions.
